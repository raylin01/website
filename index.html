ACT TIPS
Letter to the student:
Written by a veteran test taker, here is an encouragement letter for all test takers:
Dear All Students,

First of all, congratulations on making it so far (surviving the AP Course). Now it is time to demonstrate your knowledge! Although I may not be the smartest person, I do have some tips that I would like to offer:
1. Get a good nights sleep- I know a lot of people DO say this and it gets really repetitive, but its TRUE! Really, get a good nights sleep so you are awake and ready to take your APs (especially if it is a morning exam) Force yourself to go to bed by 10PM the latest!
2. Study less- If you have been working hard the whole year, which you have been, you do not need to study that much. Just focus on covering the broader points and polishing up the knowledge that you may have not remembered as well. There is no need (and its a waste of time) to go over the whole book.
3. Have some fun- Make sure to take breaks during your studying. Without breaks, you will get less and less productive and remember less and less. And, it's going to be very painful.
4. Bring the right materials- Remember, for AP tests, get the right calculators [4 function vs. TINspire] (charge them up/replace batteries day before), get enough pencils (they recommend 2-3 but I think the more the better, especially if you have two APs back to back), get extra materials (like rulers and protractors), and bring your student ID Card and AP card just in case.
5. Do not bring the wrong materials- Do not bring any pencil pouches, wrong calculators, electronics, and papers with notes written on it. If you do, you may be sent up to put it away, or even get completely removed from the test.
6. Bring a watch - You must bring a watch (provided that it is not a Beeping watch or Digital watch that connects to phones/internet). This is very helpful as you can check your own time, pace yourself, and not rely on the clocks (that you probably can not even see). Make sure you turn the beeps AND alarms off (if digital watch) the night before and CHECK that it does not beep.
7. Stay calm- These tests are designed to make you panic. They use big words, big vocab, big diagrams. Stay calm, as they usually use your panic to insert some extra information that is useless! Remember, make charts, diagrams, underline. Check for "NOT or EXCEPT" "INCREASE vs. "DECREASE"

That is all the tips that I have and hopefully it helps you. Remember to study healthily, sleep earlier, stay calm, and I wish you the best of luck on your exam(s)!

The ACT policy states that all scores higher than 34 may be held back from displaying on the first day. Some tests are examined more closely for security purposes
